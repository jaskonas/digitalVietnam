## R Markdown
Over twenty years ago, Donald Fisher Harrison of the National Archives lamented the near-complete neglect of the extensive electronic records documenting American efforts in Vietnam. 

Writing in 1988, he was hopeful that someday, anyone might be able to use ''a microcomputer and a modem'' to access and manipulate the datafiles using ''off-the-shelf technology.'' The time has arrived

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
